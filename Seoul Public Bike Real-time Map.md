# Seoul Public Bike Real-time Map
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## 1. First image when you load the map

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

You can see the map is clustered of stations as zone.<br/> 
When you move a mouse over map, also appears district line that include the stations.<br/>
<br/>
The ``` location ``` that used to load the map is Seoul Station, whose latitude and longitude are ['37.5536067','126.9674308']<br/>
And I set ```zoom_start```value as 10
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## 2. Zoomed screen
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You can still check out the clustered stations but more detailed. some icons start to show on the map.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## 3. Icons with colours (by conditions)
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When you zoom more the map, you can clearly see the icons with three colours -Blue, Green, Red.<br/>
<br/>
Colour markers make you able to distinguish approximate quantity of bycicles
  - If the bicycle having rate is more than 50% -> Blue
  - If there are fewer than two bicycles now -> Red
  - Other (There are more than 2 bycicles and having rate is less than 50%) -> Green
 Also, if you move a mouse over a icon, it says the number and name of stations, also how many available bikes has. So easy.
<br/>
Thus, you can check if the station has any bike available without zoom to specific station or click it
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## 4. Exact location of stations
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When you click or zoom in, you can get the exact location of stations
